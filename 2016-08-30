@Ali displays his progress on the FCC Helsinki logo
 - there are 4-5 different options we take a look at
 - all of them are candidates for the page
 - they are all nice and the job was very well done
 - we would need to share these - @Ali please upload these to the brain-storming github repository (maybe under /logos folder)
  - the next step would be that we give feedback, improve and decide
 - @Peter suggests to use SVG format instead of PNG
  - @Ali says he is not familiar with it
  - can anyone assist him to get started? @Irina maybe? 
We take a look at the mockup made byÂ @Irina
 - we all like the clarity and the mockup as it is done
 - it clearly forwards the vision and our idea in general
 - we don't think that anything was missed, this can be the first version mockup of the page
 - this mockup should be extended with 
   - a Functional specification document (what does what, how things work, what users can do, use cases etc.)
   - potentially a technical overview (what technologies we are planning to use etc.)
   - these are ideally done before doing any implementation - good topic for the next meeting 
 - we would be interested in the progress how this was done (what tools were utilized etc.) - @Irina could you share this with us in the next meeting maybe? :) 
 - @Irina please share this through the brain-storming github repository (maybe under /mockups folder)
 - would it be possible to have a similar image optimized for mobile phones?
@Tiia presents mobile first in practice
 - @Tiia please share your notes through the brain-storming git repository (e.g. under folder /research)
 - we identify that simplicity with such approach is essential
 - mobile devices are in focus during the development and testing
 - the worst thing what can happen in this approach is that the desktop version of the website looks "childish" - we will need to pay attention to that
 - we agreed to go with this approach and put our minds to it during future development
 - we agree that this facilitates of @Irina's work above
@Kate suggests to choose a development approach/principle
 - TDD - Test Driven Development?
 - BDD - Behavior Driven Development?
 - SRUM?
 - @Peter refers to the meeting from two weeks back in Flux - we discussed shortly about this
 - good topic next time

Next meeting:
 - in Aalto Business School near Kamppi
  - @Kate books
  - a poll will be published on Facebook about the date @Kate
 - we will look into the functional specifications in more details 
  - this would be a document around 5 pages describing what is possible on the site
  - use cases
  - mockups included
  - user stories
  - the idea is to bring everyone on the same level of understanding and keep it for future reference
 - we will start the website (to its very first version at least)
  - we would need a separate reposity for this in github - @Peter can create it, but in case not @Omid can help
 - if there is time we discuss what tools and approaches we use
  - Trello, Github, something else? 
  - TDD, Scrum? is any of these frameworks suitable?

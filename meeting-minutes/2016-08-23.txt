Approaches:
  - developed with mobile first approach in mind
  - mockups in advance of development - @Irina 

1) Front page
  - a clear message who we are and what we do
    - something catchy and funny, 3-4 words about what do we do
    - e.g. "Survive the Finnish winter with coding" / "Collaborate, Learn, Code"
  - design approach ideas:
    1) a regular "engineering-style" bootstrap page - @Irina makes a mockup
    2) a more artistic approach - @Ali's idea, mockup and/or demo application - either with or without one page design
    3) arrows on left/right/bottom which the users can click to navigate - @Irina's idea 
  - a nice logo - @Ali prepares and shares some of them with us on the next meeting
    - a bigger one and a more compact one
    - the logo in the navigation has to take the user back to the main page
  - colors:
    - in the first iteration the same green color as FCC
    - later can be extended with other themes
  - one page design
  - technologies:
      - bootstrap - maybe using a free template
      - HTML
      - later AngularJS? 
  - Actors
    - Visitor
    - User: a FCC HKI member who has login credentials to the site
  - user stories:

  - use case diagram - @Usman
  - login + registration - is it restricted? Who can register? Can they use the same credentials as on FCC.com? What do they by registering?  

2) Features

  - upcoming meetings, events

  Questions:
    - did any other countries / FCC communities did this before? - Tiia researches (maybe contact someone at FCC HQ)
      - domain from freecodecamp.com (e.g. email address info@helsinki.freecodecamp.com; webpage: helsinki.freecodecamp.com)?
3) About us / who we are + profile
  - an group photo of us where users can hover on people - might be hard to maintain 
  - when hovering on the person a profile page could open 
  - members could have a profile page where they share some information about themselves  
  
Conclusion / for next meeting: 
  - we agreed to plan plan the above in more details
  - we would need access to FCC HKI github - needs approval from @Omid
  - we will do the mockups as agreed until the next meeting @Ali, @Irina
  - Use case diagram @Usman
  - max 10 minute presentation about Mobile First approach in practice @Tiia
